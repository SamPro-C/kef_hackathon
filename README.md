# KEF Journey 98% - Hackathon Project

This project is a submission for the KEF Hackathon.

## The Concept: KEF Journey 98%

This web application aims to solve a key challenge for the Kenya Education Fund (KEF): making the incredible, transformative journeys of their scholars visible and emotionally resonant. While KEF has a proven 98% success rate in helping students transition to university, this powerful statistic often remains an abstract number.

Our solution, **KEF Journey 98%**, is an interactive storytelling platform that brings these journeys to life.

### Core Features:

1.  **The Interactive Journey:** A visual, map-based, and timeline-driven experience that allows users (donors, potential scholars, alumni) to follow the path of a KEF student from their home county to high school and on to university and a career.
2.  **Impact Calculator:** A simple tool to show donors the tangible impact of their contribution (e.g., "$50 funds a student's textbooks for a year"). This is designed to increase donor engagement and trust.
3.  **Alumni Story Spotlight:** Features rotating, filterable story cards of KEF alumni, showcasing their achievements and how they are giving back to their communities.

### "Wow" Factor for the Judges:

Our signature feature is the **Interactive Success Map**. It's a visually compelling way to demonstrate KEF's nationwide impact and the global reach of its alumni network. This isn't just data; it's a story of hope, perseverance, and success, county by county.

### Tech Stack:

*   **Framework:** Next.js (React)
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with ShadCN UI components
*   **AI/Backend:** Genkit (for potential future features like story generation)

This project is designed to be mobile-first, fast, and highly polished, focusing on a core, high-impact user experience to impress the hackathon judges.
